On my system, the heron source is located in ~/heron/incubator-heron and 
my example streamlets are located in ~/heron/heron-examples. The
scripts are based upon those locations and would have to be modified if 
used by someone else.

Given that caveat, the following steps should allow one to run the streamlet
examples.

Clone or download both:
   https://github.com/jmark99/heron-examples (master branch)
   https://github.com/jmark99/incubator-heron (acks4 branch)

My version of the acks4 branch is required since I'm currently updating the
Heron source to allow streamlets to use AT_LEAST_ONCE semantics. Note that
there is a LOT of extra logging at the moment. This will be removed
eventually.

* cd into incubator-heron directory
* hUpdateLocalRepo
      This will rebuild the heron source and install the necessary jar files
      to your local maven repo using the settings in the script. Update the
      scripts to change any necessary paths or names.
* cd into the directory containing the heron-examples.
* mvn clean assembly:assembly
     Note the POM needs to be cleaned up, but I haven't bothered to do so yet.

At this point you should be able to run the example code using either the
simulator or via the local cluster.

* hRunExamples <class-name> i.e., hRunExamples SimpleMapStreamlet 
      (will run in simulator)
  or
* hRunExamples <class-name> <topology-name> , i.e., hRunExamples IntegerProcessingStreamlet integerTopology
      (will run in local cluster. Will have to activate the topology)

If you prefer to run with the full command, it would look like:

heron submit local target/heron-examples-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.jmo.streamlets.SimpleMapStreamlet <topology-name> --deploy-deactivated
